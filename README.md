# To Do List

This is a simple webpage to do list app coded in angular. I implemented auth0 and wrote a testcafe script to test functionality. 

## Testcafe
Download testcafe then run 
 
 `testcafe safari testcafetest.ts`
 
 or replace safari with your browser of choice. For me, the test only worked for Safari, and I'm not sure why.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
